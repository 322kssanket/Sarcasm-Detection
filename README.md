# Sarcasm-Detection(Group Project)
Key Natural Language Processing Problem known as Sarcasm Detection using a combination of models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).Other than this approach there are two other improvements approach using which we can solve this problem efficiently. These two other approaches are : 1) Using RNN architectures, 2) BERT pre-trained model.
